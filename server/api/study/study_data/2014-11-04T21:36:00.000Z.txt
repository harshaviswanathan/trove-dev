Patchy nonspecific lucencies within the periventricular|and subcortical white matter, left greater than right, particularly|within the centrum semiovale, Compatible with severe chronic|microvascular ischemic changes.     No acute loss of gray-white|differentiation. No extra-axial fluid collection is identified. No|intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. The basal|cisterns are patent. | |The bony structures are unremarkable. There is a small amount of|aerosolized secretions within the bilateral sphenoid sinuses. The|bilateral mastoid air cells are well-aerated.| |Impression: |1.  No CT evidence of acute infarction. No intracranial hemorrhage. MRI|is more sensitive for acute infarct and may be obtained if clinically|indicated.|2.  Mild generalized parenchymal volume loss and severe chronic white|matter microvascular ischemic disease.|3.  Small amount of aerosolized secretions within the bilateral sphenoid|sinuses, which in the appropriate clinical setting may represent acute|sinusitis.| |  Prepared By: Chen, Liyang Leon MD                                           |  Study interpreted and report approved by: Chazen, Joseph Levi MD            |  Electronically signed Diagnostic Report Imaging Report                      |  11/04/2014 03:46 PM - 11/04/2014 04:36 PM                                   |  Exam Complete - Signed-Off                                                  ","service_code":"NCTHDBNWO","service_description":"NEURO CT HEAD BRAIN WO CONTRAST","linked_orders":"","modality":"CT        ","result_status":"F","result_time":"201411041636","completed_time":"20141104154600","scheduled_time":"20141104150500"}
